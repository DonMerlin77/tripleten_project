# tripleten_project
For sprint 4 of TripleTen bootcamp

The purpose of the app is to display data for vehicles in the US and to see how the price can fluxuate based on either the odometer reading and 4wd. As well as look at the spread of the conditions of the cars. We can toggle the color for the price scattorplot, we can pick which 4wd histogram we are looking at either is 4wd, not 4wd, or both at the same time. The odometer section will display two histograms side by side to compare number of cars and odometer reading; as well as, total sum of price of cars per odometer reading.
